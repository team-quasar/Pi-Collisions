# Pi-Collisions
Based on 3b1b's vid!
Check it out here: https://team-quasar.github.io/Pi-Collisions/

The concept was inspired by a youtube video by 3Blue1Brown that claimed that the digits of Pi can be formed by counting the perfectly elastic collisions of two blocks and a wall. By following the laws of perfectly elastic collisions, momentum, and energy, me and my partner were able to write code that simulated the theory. The code works for up to 3 digits of Pi. This was my second hackathon project. This being my second hackathon, I'd learned a lot about time management and programming websites since and from the first hackathon. We were able to streamline the process and write efficient code and it lead to a website that looked nice and performed how I'd expect it to perform. We won the Best Computational Hack award at this hackathon. (AtomHacks)
